	<br><strong>DDI 2.5:</strong> Universe: The group of persons or other elements that are the object of research and to which any analytic results refer. Age,nationality, and residence commonly help to delineate a given universe, but any of a number of factors may be involved, such as sex, race, income, veteran status, criminal convictions, etc. The universe may consist of elements other than persons, such as housing units, court cases, deaths, countries, etc. In general, it should be possible to tell from the description of the universe whether a given individual or element (hypothetical or real) is a member of the population under study. A "level" attribute is included to permit coding of the level to which universe applies, i.e., the study level, the file level (if different from study), the record group, the variable group, the nCube group, the variable, or the nCube level. The "clusion" attribute provides for specification of groups included (I) in or excluded (E) from the universe.
