A "level" attribute is included to permit coding of the level to which universe applies, i.e., the study level, the file level (if different from study), the record group, the variable group, the nCube group, the variable, or the nCube level. The "clusion" attribute provides for specification of groups included (I) in or excluded (E) from the universe.
