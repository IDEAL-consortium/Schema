    <ul>
      <li>Please indicate the number of experiments being evaluated in the paper.</li>
      <li>An experiment is principally defined by the study population and unit of randomization, the intervention, and the randomization used to create comparable treatment arms.</li>
      <li>If results are reported from multiple countries, these are likely coming from different experiments.</li>
      <li>Normally, there is only one experiment being evaluated in a paper, but there are exceptions. Please see the example column. The experimental design section often provides information on how many experiments are being tested in the paper.</li>
      <li>Note that in the pilot, we are not coding studies that are lab-in-the-field experiments. If a study includes a field experiment and a lab-in-the-field experiment, we will only code the field experiment. In that case, please enter 1 for this field.</li>
      <li>We are also not coding studies in which there is a design intervention rather than a policy intervention. A design intervention includes studies that randomize the order or wording of survey questions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Descriptive example</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Barrera-Osorio et al. 2011:</strong> Report effects from two different experiments in Bogota in different parts of the city (San Cristobal and Suba). We know that there are two different experiments because the paper declares "As required by the SED, the assessment of the treatments was divided into two separate experiments located in two very similar localities in Bogota, San Cristobal, and Suba." The paper also reports that eligible populations for the tested interventions are different across the two sites: "Eligible registrants in San Cristobal, ranging from grade 6–11..."; and "The tertiary treatment was evaluated separately in an experiment in Suba, where students ranging from grade nine through eleven..." The response to this field would be <strong>2</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Jeong et al. 2023:</strong> Evaluate the differences in how question modules in a survey are ordered in order to examine the effects of survey fatigue. In this case, the coder should enter <strong>0</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>De Martino et al. 2015:</strong> Conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment on landholders and annual payment offers for environmental services. As the experiment conducted was hypothetical, the coder should enter <strong>0</strong>.

      <li>Go to the previous question to revise your answer if you think the number of experiments should be 1.</li>
      <li>Select "Confirm that there is no eligible experiment reported in the paper" if you believe the experiment reported in the paper is not an RCT or not a field RCT. This could include cases where a study only reports lab-in-the field experiments or a design intervention that randomizes the order or wording of survey questions. Note that this will be a rare case since all assigned papers have been pre-screened. The survey will stop after you select this option. Please notify your supervisor that the paper is not eligible for coding.</li>
      <li>Select "Confirm that there is more than one experiment reported in the paper" when the paper evaluates more than one experiment. In that case, please enter the information for each experiment separately into different survey entries.</li>
      <li>Please reach out to your supervisors if you are not sure about your answer to this question.</li>

      <h3>Coding instructions for coders (Hint on SurveyCTO)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Parallel: This is the most common strategy used in randomized control trials. Each intervention is assigned to only one arm.</li>
        <li>Factorial: This design is used when evaluating the impact of two or more interventions alone and in combination with each other. At least one intervention is assigned to more than one study arm.</li>
        <li>Crossover: This is used when each study arm receives different interventions (including no intervention) in different phases of the study. Also select this option for phase-in or stepped-wedge designs, where the roll-out of the intervention is randomized and every unit ultimately receives the program. If the study endline occurs prior to units receiving interventions beyond what they were initially assigned to, do not select this option.</li>
        <li>Adaptive: In adaptive designs, the rule by which interventions are randomly assigned can change in the course of the trial, based on the experimental data. For example, in a trial conducted in multiple waves, the number of units assigned to each treatment arm may change across waves based on results in prior waves. Alternatively, in a longitudinal cross-over design, the next intervention to which an experimental unit is "switched" (or the time of switching) may depend on the outcome under the current intervention.</li>
        <li>Other: If the assignment strategy does not fit in any of the above categories, select this option</li>
        <li>Information on the assignment strategy is found in the experimental/study design or methods sections of a paper. When available, the coder may also consult how an intervention is described in a study participant flow diagram.</li>
        <li>Note that authors may use the word phased-in while describing rollout of a program, even if the intervention assignment strategy is parallel or factorial.</li>
        <li>Note also that some studies may feature a phase-in design or analyze a pilot program, in which a broader population ultimately receives the intervention(s). However, if the study endline is conducted prior to the phase-in of the rest of the units or before the program is expanded, the study will still be included if it has a parallel or factorial intervention assignment strategy.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Descriptive example</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Parallel:</strong> In Barrera-Osorio et al, 2022, authors evaluate the performance-based reward program by randomizing primary schools into three distinct groups -- recognition, in-kind performance reward, and control [see: Sample and experimental design]. The response to this field is parallel</li>
        <li><strong>Factorial:</strong> In Andrew et al, 2018 researchers randomized towns into four groups. The first received the psychosocial stimulation only (PS), the second received multiple micronutrient supplementation only (MN), the third received both interventions (PS and MN), and the fourth received neither (Control). The response to this field is factorial design because one arm receives the combination intervention PS + MN.</li>
        <li><strong>Crossover:</strong> In Lopez et al, 2022 authors vary in which days doctors received a doctor-specific intervention, and in which days patients received a patient-specific intervention. As doctors (and patients) can cross between the control and treatment groups, the response to this field is crossover design [see: Data collection, figure 2]. In Miguel and Kremer, 2004 authors vary the timing in which three groups of randomly selected schools receive school-based deworming. As the control group crosses over into the treatment group by the end of the study, the response to this field is crossover.</li>

      <h3>Descriptive example</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Barrera-Osorio et al., 2022</strong> have two distinct interventions. "Out of this sample, 140 schools were randomly assigned to each of the two treatment arms – recognition or in-kind performance rewards – and 140 schools were randomly assigned to the control." For this field, the response would be <strong>2 interventions</strong>. [see: Intervention, sample and experimental design]</li>
        <li><strong>Ozler et al, 2018</strong> have four separate arms and four unique intervention components. Out of the four interventions, one was common to all arms though not part of the status quo in child care centers outside the study sample. The response for this field would be <strong>4 interventions</strong>: 1. Learning materials and supplies, 2. teacher training and mentoring, 3. teacher incentives, and 4. parenting training. [see: Interventions]</li>
        <li><strong>Egger et al., 2022</strong> The two interventions are "cash transfer, high saturation" and "cash transfer, low saturation". The cash transfer provided to the household is the same in both interventions, but in one arm a larger share of households receive the transfer, so the intensity of treatment at the village level is different. This means there are two different (village level) interventions. [see: Figure A1]</li>
        <li><strong>Miguel and Kremer (2004)</strong> have a crossover design, in which the deworming treatment is phased in to different schools in different years: "Group 1 schools received free deworming treatment in both 1998 and 1999, Group 2 schools in 1999, while Group 3 schools began receiving treatment in 2001" (page 165). There are three "interventions" in this study, one is the program intervention: "free deworming treatment". The other two are "timing interventions" specific to the crossover design: treatment in 1998 and treatment in 1999. Note that "treatment in 2001" happened after the study period, so should not be included in the interventions.</li>

      <h3>Coding instructions for coders (Hint on SurveyCTO)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Indicate the randomization technique used to assign any interventions to experimental units in the study. Instead of simple randomization, most researchers use methods to balance the number of randomization units across study arms (blocking or other methods of fixed-share assignment); stratification (including matched-pair designs), re-randomization, and covariate adaptive sampling additionally balance subgroups of the sample (strata) across arms.</li>
        <li>Simple randomization or fixed-share random assignment. Simple randomization refers to assigning each randomization unit to one of the treatment arms with a fixed probability, e.g. choosing the treatment arm for each unit with a coin flip or by drawing a ball (with replacement) from a 50:50 urn. With simple randomization, the size of the treatment arms can randomly vary. Fixed-share random assignment refers to randomly assigning a fixed share of the sample to each treatment arm, e.g. by randomly selecting one half of the sample for treatment or by drawing each unit's assignment "without replacement" from a 50:50 urn. Use this option for any fixed-share assignment method other than blocking. Sometimes, the paper may not be clear about which of the two methods was used exactly, e.g. we randomly assigned 48 units to treatment and 49 units to control. In that case, you should select this option unless other randomization methods listed below were used.</li>
        <li>Block randomization or permutation blocking is a method of fixed-share random assignment in which the sample is divided into "blocks", and each block is (randomly) assigned a treatment arm permutation. For example, with blocks of two units, the randomly assigned permutations are either C/T or T/C (but not C/C or T/T). This method is particularly suitable if units arrive sequentially. The description of the randomization procedure will use phrases such as "blocked assignment" or "randomization within blocks." Use this option if blocking is used for fixed-share assignment, but there is no stratification on covariates. When block randomization is used, please do not select "Simple randomization or fixed-share random assignment (without blocking)".</li>
        <li>Stratification (blocked or other) covers all stratification methods other than pure matched pair designs. If stratification is used in any part of randomization, select this option regardless of other methods used. Stratification serves to balance specific characteristics of the sample (covariates) across treatment arms. The sample is divided into subgroups ("strata") and fixed-share assignment are used within each stratum (the exact method may not be explicitly mentioned). In most papers, stratification will appear in the description of the randomization procedure and will use phrases such as "stratified by.." or "balanced the assignment by.." (e.g. "by gender") or "randomly assigned within" (e.g. "half of the households within each village were randomly chosen to receive…"). When blocked stratified randomization is used, the strata may themselves be the blocks (e.g. "block-randomized 5 sites per region..."). Note that stratification is sometimes also used in sampling, to ensure that each stratum is represented in the study Mark stratification here ONLY if the paper uses stratified randomization. Also note that, when randomization is done in stages, the second stage randomization may be stratified by the randomization results of the first stage. Please select this option if this is the case.</li>
        <li>Matched pair design is a specific type of stratified randomization. Here, randomization units are grouped into pairs ("matched") based on baseline characteristics, and within each pair, one unit is randomly assigned to the treatment and the other to the control. The term is typically explicitly used, but if the researchers describe the design as stratification where all strata are of size 2, please choose this option. If pair matching is used in addition to other stratification methods, please use "Stratification (blocked or other)".</li>
        <li>Covariate adaptive randomization is a method for balancing the sample across arms that applies if units of randomization arrive sequentially, such as patients at a clinic. It varies the assignment probability of each unit based on the covariate distribution among units that arrived previously. It typically attempts to minimize any covariate imbalance in random assignments.</li>
        <li>Re-randomization is another method to achieve balance. It consists of repeating a specific randomization procedure (e.g. simple or fixed-share random assignment) and selecting the "most balanced" assignment. The authors may conduct a pre-specified number of randomizations or re-randomize until a pre-specified balance criterion is met. Re-randomization is sometimes combined with stratification. In this case, select "Stratification (blocked or other)".</li>
        <li>Other or not specified Please use this category if the exact method of assignment is not specified, or if another assignment method is used, for example, adaptive sampling with objectives other than covariate balancing.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Descriptive example</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>In Andrew et al, 2018</strong> "Randomization was done at the level of a town and after a stratification by region" [Randomization and masking]. This indicates that towns were randomized in equal proportion to be assigned treatment or control arms Therefore, the response for this field would be "Stratification (blocked or other)".</li>
        <li><strong>In Stewart et al. (2020),</strong> the authors report that they "block-randomized 5 sites per treatment arm per region" into the five study arms. The correct answer is "Stratification (blocked or other)". Note that here the strata (the regions) are used as blocks.</li>

The correct answer here would be <strong>3</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>In Dupas (2011),</strong> the author notes that the randomization procedure is stratified by teacher training status. The correct answer here would be <strong>1</strong>.</li>

      <h3>Coding instructions for coders (Hint on SurveyCTO)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>List each of the stratification variables out in the order in which they appear in the paper.</li>
        <li>Use indicators for being assigned to an intervention (e.g. indicator for being assigned to provider incentive) if randomization at a lower level is stratified by groups generated by higher-level randomization of one or more other interventions.</li>
        <li>If local terms are used to define the strata - for example, woreda, oblast, union, or taluka - please retain the local term rather than using the author's translation of them into English.</li>
        <li>This information is mostly found in the randomization or methods section of the paper. Phrases such as "stratified by...", "randomly assigned within..." are common when describing stratification variables.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Descriptive example</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Since the response to 10 for Andrew et al, 2018 is Strata.</strong> Using text from the paper "Randomisation was done at the level of the cluster (town), after stratification by region. Within each of the 3 regions, 8 towns were randomly allocated to each of the 3 treatment groups and the control group using computer-generated random numbers" [Randomization and masking]. The response to this field would be "region" since that is the variable that makes up the strata as indicated in the paper.</li>
        <li><strong>In Freeman et al. (2022),</strong> authors use a stratified randomization design so the response to the previous question asking if the intervention was stratified is "Strata". The authors note "a stratified random design at the woreda-level was used to assign an equal number of study kebeles to either the Andilaye intervention or the control group receiving no intervention". The response to this question is "Woreda", as it is the local term used consistently throughout the paper.</li>

      </ul>
      <h3>Descriptive example</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>In Ozler et al, 2018,</strong> a "block randomization" was used to assign childcare centers in each district to the four study arms. "Centers were grouped based on mean height-for-age (HAZ) and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT - a measure of receptive vocabulary) z-scores, both of which were collected at baseline. The Ministry held a public lottery at each district capital where a representative from each center was asked to draw a colored dot from an envelope to determine that center's treatment status." The response to this question would be "Yes", as the same set of variables were used for stratification.</li>
        <li><strong>In Wolf et al. 2019,</strong> there are two stages of randomization. In the first stage, the intervention assignment was stratified by district and public/private status of the school. In the second stage, the interventions were assigned within groups created by treatment assignment in the first stage. The stratification variable is indicator for teacher training/parental awareness assignment. The response to this question would be "No", since the stratification variables are different across interventions.</li>

        <li>This information is mostly found in the randomization and methods sections of the paper. For most papers, this information will appear in the same paragraph as the one describing the stratification procedure.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Descriptive example</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wolf et al, 2018</strong> has 4 interventions and 5 study arms: Teacher training and coaching program; Parental awareness meetings; Text messages for teachers; Picture-based paper flyers or texts for parents. Based on the information in the section "Randomization", in a first stage of randomization, three of the interventions (teacher training and coaching program; and parental awareness meetings) were stratified by district and public/private status of the school. The text messages for teachers and the texts/flyers for parents were assigned in a second stage of randomization. These interventions were stratified by treatment assignment in the previous stage so that stratification variables for this assignment of interventions to arms would be indicators for being assigned to the two of the arms. So for this field, the stratification mapping for 5 study arms would be: Control - district and public/private status of the school; Teacher training and coaching program - district and public/private status of the school; Parental awareness meetings - district and public/private status of the school; Text messages for teachers - indicator for school being part of teacher training and coaching program; Picture-based paper flyers for parents - indicator for school being part of program with teacher training & coaching and parental awareness meetings</li>

        <li>Enter the total number of rounds of data collection reported in the paper, including baseline. A round collects data from the same data source at a given time. In other words, a round signals when different outcomes are measured.</li>
        <li>For studies in which data is only collected by surveys of subjects in the sample, the number of rounds typically aligns with the number of surveys (e.g., baseline, midline, endline = 3 rounds).</li>

Table 1 suggests that the register data was collected between September and December 2017. Appendix C indicates that the authors received "the up-to-date MAO and bank-based datasets at three points in time: once in July, once in August and once in September 2018. Therefore, there are seven rounds of data collection in the study. The response for this field is <strong>7</strong>.</li>

      <h3>Coding instructions for coders (Hint on SurveyCTO)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Label the round of data collection with descriptive names, such as "baseline", "midline", "midline phone survey", "endline", "one-year follow-up", "three-year follow up" etc.</li>
        <li>Retain any descriptive labels used by the study authors, such as "18-month follow up" or "23-month follow up."</li>
        <li>Use the data source to differentiate datasets collected at the same time, for example, phone survey at follow-up and census data at follow-up.</li>
        <li>This can be found in the "data collection" or "data sources" section for papers. Sometimes, papers have explanatory diagrams on timeline and implementation which coders can consult to get the different points of time in which data was collected. Tables with treatment effects can also illuminate the different rounds of data collection.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Descriptive example</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Freeman et al, 2022</strong> study collect household surveys and observations-based data at baseline, midline, and end line. [see: Data collection] Additionally, Figure 2 illuminates the points in time when each of the data collection rounds was conducted. The response for this field would be: Baseline, Midline, Endline</li>
        <li><strong>Ozler et al, 2018</strong> use three rounds of data collection [see: Data sources] The response for this field would be: Baseline, 18-month follow-up, 36-month follow-up</li>
        <li><strong>For Muralidharan et al. 2021,</strong> which draw on three administrative data sources and have seven total rounds, the round names would be: Register of landlords September – December 2017, Bank-based dataset July 2018, MAO record dataset July 2018, Bank-based dataset August 2018, MAO record dataset August 2018, Bank-based dataset September 2018, Mao record dataset September 2018</li>
        <li><strong>Pande & Field, 2008</strong> only use online endline data on loans and repayment in the current paper. The round name would be: Endline.</li>

      <h3>Coding instructions for coders (Hint on SurveyCTO)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>List the number of unique comparisons presented in the table. Any reported treatment effect is the result of a comparison of one group against another on an outcome, where a group can be a single study arm or a group of arms.</li>
        <li>In a case where there are 4 experimental groups (Treatment A, Treatment B, Treatment A+B, and a Control), many comparisons may be reported. We may see treatment effect for Treatment A relative to the Control, or we may see an estimate for the difference between Treatment A and the combination Treatment A+B. Understanding which comparison is being reported in a table or figure will be important if the row and column labels and table/figure notes do not contain this information.</li>
        <li>This information can be present either in the top row or column of a table or it may be reported in the rows as the variables for which treatment effects are being reported. The base arm for comparison is often the omitted category in a regression and/or mentioned in the footnotes of a table. Descriptions of each treatment effect in the results section can also illuminate the contrast under study for each estimate.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Descriptive example</h3>
      <p>In table 3 from Ozler et al, 2018:<br>
      - We see 3 comparisons in the first panel of rows:<br>

      2. T3 (T2 + teacher incentives) vs. Control<br>
      3. T4 (T2 + parenting training) vs. Control<br>
      - We see 1 additional comparison in the second panel of rows that pools all treatment groups into 1 group.<br>
      4. Any Treatment (T2, T3, or T4) vs. Control<br>
      - The fourth panel of rows contains the precision but not treatment effects for additional comparisons:<br>
      (i) T2 vs. T3<br>

        <li>Most times each period only involves one round of data collection. But authors may pool several rounds of data collection into one extended period for some analysis. [See examples in the Descriptive example column]</li>
        <li>When authors combine rounds of data collections, the number of periods in any given table may exceed the total number of rounds of data collection.</li>
        <li>In general, the baseline is not a period. This is because studies do not estimate the treatment effect at the time of the baseline survey/ However, if the authors use a difference-in-differences design to estimate the treatment effect, then the baseline is included in the period.</li>

      <h3>Descriptive example</h3>
      <p>In Hanna et al., 2016, table 3 presents 5 periods used to calculate treatment effects. The first row reports a period that includes all four rounds of midline and endline surveys in estimating the treatment effects. The following rows report the treatment effects in each individual period of midline and endline surveys (one per year since the treatment was administered). Coders should report "5" for this field, 1 each for the 4 separate yearly mid- and end-line surveys and 1 for the pooled endline.<br><br>
      In contrast, in Ozler et al, 2018, table 3,the title of the table specifies the results are for the 18-month follow up. Coders should report "1" for this field, as only one round of data collection was used in this table.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Please identify and indicate the number of unique empirical specifications used to estimate treatment effects in the exhibit.</li>
        <li>A unique empirical specification is defined by the inclusion (or not) of strata correction, baseline outcome and other controls. This table illustrates all 8 types of specifications, and a coder should count how many of them were used to estimate treatment effect in the exhibit.</li>
        <li>Baseline value of outcome refers to the baseline value of the outcome for which the treatment effect is being estimated. Controls for baseline values of other variables are not included in baseline value of outcome.</li>
        <li>Controls include those are observed before treatment assignment refer to variables measured at baseline, as well as the ones that are measured after baseline but are considered to be static over the study period - for example, parental education in the context of a program targeting children, gender in the context of a program that is not assumed to affect gender identity, or residence in a flood-prone zone in a context of a program that is not assumed to affect choice of residence.</li>
        <li>A simple difference in means with no additional information on the specification used or the presence of any adjustment should be considered as "No other controls". Likewise, a regression with just the outcome of interest as the dependent variable and just an indicator for treatment status as the sole independent variable should be coded as "No other controls."</li>
        <li>Information on specifications can be found in both data and statistical analysis sections and table notes. In some papers, authors report the regression specification or empirical model used to estimate treatment effects and/or indicate their specification in column labels in tables. Sometimes, authors add additional details about specifications to table notes only. In other studies, this information must be inferred from the text and/or notes that accompany tables or figures.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Descriptive example</h3>
      <p>In Riley, 2024, E. The empirical Strategy describes the specifications in equation (1) that strata dummies and the baseline value of the outcome (if measured at baseline, otherwise excluded) are included in the estimation of treatment effects. In Table 1, where full sample results are reported, the notes indicate "All regressions include strata dummies and include the baseline value of the outcomes."<br><br>
      The response to this question is: 1<br><br>
      In Ashraf et al., 2010, according to tables notes, in Table 2, two specifications are used for each outcome: with and without baseline controls (including baseline Clorin usage and water cholorination, general health behaviors and attitudes, household demographics, and locality fixed effects).<br><br>
      The response to this question is: 2<br><br>
      Grossman and Baldassarri, 2012 report treatment effects using four set of specifications in Table 2 including no controls, individual controls, monitor profile (post-treatment control), and both individual controls and monitor profile. There are in total 4 specifications.<br><br>
      The response to this question is: 4</p>

<summary>Stage 2 Fields</summary>

<div style="padding: 1rem;">
  <p>This survey is going to go through each of the exhibits you specified in Stage 1 (and also verified by a supervisor) that reported treatment effects. The questions will allow us to match and specify the treatment effects that are eligible for data extraction for IDEAL.</p>
  <p>Section notes: Exhibit information</p>
  <p>In Stage 1, you reported that {Exhibit label} includes {Number of comparisons} contrast(s) and {Number of outcome variables in the table} outcome(s). In the next questions you will be asked to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Identify the IDEAL eligible treatment effect for each outcome-contrast pair.</li>
    <li>Describe the empirical specification and rounds of data collection used to estimate those treatment effects.</li>
  </ol>

    <p>How many IDEAL eligible treatment effects in the exhibit are you going to report?</p>
    <h3>Definition (LABEL on SurveyCTO)</h3>

    <h3>Response options</h3>
    <p>Numeric</p>
    <h3>CV (Choices on SurveyCTO)</h3>
    <p>Integer greater than zero</p>
    <h3>SurveyCTO instructions for data entry mask and repeat level</h3>
    <p>Repeat for each table identified in Stage 1.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Coding instructions for coders (Hint on SurveyCTO)</h3>
    <p>Count the number of IDEAL treatment effect estimates you plan to report for this exhibit.</p>
    <h3>What estimates to count</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>For each possible outcome-contrast pair, the total number of IDEAL-eligible treatment effects depends on the specification and the rounds of data collection.</li>
      <li>It is possible that no treatment effect is reported in the table for a given contrast-outcome pair. However, each outcome and contrast in the exhibit should be related to at least one treatment effect.</li>
      <li>Only count full sample results.</li>
      <li>Do not count estimates from interaction terms.</li>
      <li>Count ITT estimates. Only count LATE / TOT estimates if they are preferred by the author or they are the only estimates reported.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to count data collection rounds</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If treatment effects are estimated for multiple rounds of data collection, count each round as a separate treatment effect.</li>
      <li>For example, if the same treatment effect is estimated separately for the "first follow-up survey" and the "second follow-up survey," each estimate should be counted as a distinct treatment effect, regardless of the specification used.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to count specifications</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>When multiple treatment effects are reported for a contrast-outcome pair, only two of them will be eligible for IDEAL:</li>
      <li>IDEAL-preferred specification: Count the treatment effects estimated using the highest-ranked IDEAL-preferred specification.</li>
      <li>Author-preferred specification: Only count the author-preferred specification as separate treatment effect if it differs from the IDEAL-preferred specification.</li>
      <li>The ranking of IDEAL-preferred specifications can be found here (click to open new page): <a href="https://ideal-consortium.github.io/Schema/IDEAL_Ranking_Index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ideal-consortium.github.io/Schema/IDEAL_Ranking_Index.html</a></li>

    <p>For each field, explain what you were uncertain about and (if applicable) which options you were considering.</p>
    <h3>Descriptive examples for coding</h3>
    <p>For example, if a coder selects the "Estimand is full sample ITT and LATE/TOT" field in the request-for-review section, they could add an explanation about their uncertainty in this field.</p>
    <p>"Unsure regarding the empirical specification of the estimand. The author mentions that "we view the evaluation design as quasi-experimental and use difference-in-differences to estimate program impact." Are the estimates indirectly ITT/LATE/TOT or are they only quasi-experimental estimates?"</p>
