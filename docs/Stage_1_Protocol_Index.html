    <ul>
      <li>Please indicate the number of experiments being evaluated in the paper.</li>
      <li>An experiment is principally defined by the study population and unit of randomization, the intervention, and the randomization used to create comparable treatment arms.</li>
      <li>If results are reported from multiple countries, these are likely coming from different experiments.</li>
      <li>Normally, there is only one experiment being evaluated in a paper, but there are exceptions. Please see the example column. The experimental design section often provides information on how many experiments are being tested in the paper.</li>
      <li>Note that in the pilot, we are not coding studies that are lab-in-the-field experiments. If a study includes a field experiment and a lab-in-the-field experiment, we will only code the field experiment. In that case, please enter 1 for this field.</li>
      <li>We are also not coding studies in which there is a design intervention rather than a policy intervention. A design intervention includes studies that randomize the order or wording of survey questions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Descriptive example</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Barrera-Osorio et al. 2011:</strong> Report effects from two different experiments in Bogota in different parts of the city (San Cristobal and Suba). We know that there are two different experiments because the paper declares "As required by the SED, the assessment of the treatments was divided into two separate experiments located in two very similar localities in Bogota, San Cristobal, and Suba." The paper also reports that eligible populations for the tested interventions are different across the two sites: "Eligible registrants in San Cristobal, ranging from grade 6–11..."; and "The tertiary treatment was evaluated separately in an experiment in Suba, where students ranging from grade nine through eleven..." The response to this field would be <strong>2</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Jeong et al. 2023:</strong> Evaluate the differences in how question modules in a survey are ordered in order to examine the effects of survey fatigue. In this case, the coder should enter <strong>0</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>De Martino et al. 2015:</strong> Conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment on landholders and annual payment offers for environmental services. As the experiment conducted was hypothetical, the coder should enter <strong>0</strong>.

      <li>Go to the previous question to revise your answer if you think the number of experiments should be 1.</li>
      <li>Select "Confirm that there is no eligible experiment reported in the paper" if you believe the experiment reported in the paper is not an RCT or not a field RCT. This could include cases where a study only reports lab-in-the field experiments or a design intervention that randomizes the order or wording of survey questions. Note that this will be a rare case since all assigned papers have been pre-screened. The survey will stop after you select this option. Please notify your supervisor that the paper is not eligible for coding.</li>
      <li>Select "Confirm that there is more than one experiment reported in the paper" when the paper evaluates more than one experiment. In that case, please enter the information for each experiment separately into different survey entries.</li>
      <li>Please reach out to your supervisors if you are not sure about your answer to this question.</li>

      <h3>Coding instructions for coders (Hint on SurveyCTO)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Parallel: This is the most common strategy used in randomized control trials. Each intervention is assigned to only one arm.</li>
        <li>Factorial: This design is used when evaluating the impact of two or more interventions alone and in combination with each other. At least one intervention is assigned to more than one study arm.</li>
        <li>Crossover: This is used when each study arm receives different interventions (including no intervention) in different phases of the study. Also select this option for phase-in or stepped-wedge designs, where the roll-out of the intervention is randomized and every unit ultimately receives the program. If the study endline occurs prior to units receiving interventions beyond what they were initially assigned to, do not select this option.</li>
        <li>Adaptive: In adaptive designs, the rule by which interventions are randomly assigned can change in the course of the trial, based on the experimental data. For example, in a trial conducted in multiple waves, the number of units assigned to each treatment arm may change across waves based on results in prior waves. Alternatively, in a longitudinal cross-over design, the next intervention to which an experimental unit is "switched" (or the time of switching) may depend on the outcome under the current intervention.</li>
        <li>Other: If the assignment strategy does not fit in any of the above categories, select this option</li>
        <li>Information on the assignment strategy is found in the experimental/study design or methods sections of a paper. When available, the coder may also consult how an intervention is described in a study participant flow diagram.</li>
        <li>Note that authors may use the word phased-in while describing rollout of a program, even if the intervention assignment strategy is parallel or factorial.</li>
        <li>Note also that some studies may feature a phase-in design or analyze a pilot program, in which a broader population ultimately receives the intervention(s). However, if the study endline is conducted prior to the phase-in of the rest of the units or before the program is expanded, the study will still be included if it has a parallel or factorial intervention assignment strategy.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Descriptive example</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Parallel:</strong> In Barrera-Osorio et al, 2022, authors evaluate the performance-based reward program by randomizing primary schools into three distinct groups -- recognition, in-kind performance reward, and control [see: Sample and experimental design]. The response to this field is parallel</li>
        <li><strong>Factorial:</strong> In Andrew et al, 2018 researchers randomized towns into four groups. The first received the psychosocial stimulation only (PS), the second received multiple micronutrient supplementation only (MN), the third received both interventions (PS and MN), and the fourth received neither (Control). The response to this field is factorial design because one arm receives the combination intervention PS + MN.</li>
        <li><strong>Crossover:</strong> In Lopez et al, 2022 authors vary in which days doctors received a doctor-specific intervention, and in which days patients received a patient-specific intervention. As doctors (and patients) can cross between the control and treatment groups, the response to this field is crossover design [see: Data collection, figure 2]. In Miguel and Kremer, 2004 authors vary the timing in which three groups of randomly selected schools receive school-based deworming. As the control group crosses over into the treatment group by the end of the study, the response to this field is crossover.</li>

      <h3>Descriptive example</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Barrera-Osorio et al., 2022</strong> have two distinct interventions. "Out of this sample, 140 schools were randomly assigned to each of the two treatment arms – recognition or in-kind performance rewards – and 140 schools were randomly assigned to the control." For this field, the response would be <strong>2 interventions</strong>. [see: Intervention, sample and experimental design]</li>
        <li><strong>Ozler et al, 2018</strong> have four separate arms and four unique intervention components. Out of the four interventions, one was common to all arms though not part of the status quo in child care centers outside the study sample. The response for this field would be <strong>4 interventions</strong>: 1. Learning materials and supplies, 2. teacher training and mentoring, 3. teacher incentives, and 4. parenting training. [see: Interventions]</li>
        <li><strong>Egger et al., 2022</strong> The two interventions are "cash transfer, high saturation" and "cash transfer, low saturation". The cash transfer provided to the household is the same in both interventions, but in one arm a larger share of households receive the transfer, so the intensity of treatment at the village level is different. This means there are two different (village level) interventions. [see: Figure A1]</li>
        <li><strong>Miguel and Kremer (2004)</strong> have a crossover design, in which the deworming treatment is phased in to different schools in different years: "Group 1 schools received free deworming treatment in both 1998 and 1999, Group 2 schools in 1999, while Group 3 schools began receiving treatment in 2001" (page 165). There are three "interventions" in this study, one is the program intervention: "free deworming treatment". The other two are "timing interventions" specific to the crossover design: treatment in 1998 and treatment in 1999. Note that "treatment in 2001" happened after the study period, so should not be included in the interventions.</li>

      <h3>Coding instructions for coders (Hint on SurveyCTO)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Indicate the randomization technique used to assign any interventions to experimental units in the study. Instead of simple randomization, most researchers use methods to balance the number of randomization units across study arms (blocking or other methods of fixed-share assignment); stratification (including matched-pair designs), re-randomization, and covariate adaptive sampling additionally balance subgroups of the sample (strata) across arms.</li>
        <li>Simple randomization or fixed-share random assignment. Simple randomization refers to assigning each randomization unit to one of the treatment arms with a fixed probability, e.g. choosing the treatment arm for each unit with a coin flip or by drawing a ball (with replacement) from a 50:50 urn. With simple randomization, the size of the treatment arms can randomly vary. Fixed-share random assignment refers to randomly assigning a fixed share of the sample to each treatment arm, e.g. by randomly selecting one half of the sample for treatment or by drawing each unit's assignment "without replacement" from a 50:50 urn. Use this option for any fixed-share assignment method other than blocking. Sometimes, the paper may not be clear about which of the two methods was used exactly, e.g. we randomly assigned 48 units to treatment and 49 units to control. In that case, you should select this option unless other randomization methods listed below were used.</li>
        <li>Block randomization or permutation blocking is a method of fixed-share random assignment in which the sample is divided into "blocks", and each block is (randomly) assigned a treatment arm permutation. For example, with blocks of two units, the randomly assigned permutations are either C/T or T/C (but not C/C or T/T). This method is particularly suitable if units arrive sequentially. The description of the randomization procedure will use phrases such as "blocked assignment" or "randomization within blocks." Use this option if blocking is used for fixed-share assignment, but there is no stratification on covariates. When block randomization is used, please do not select "Simple randomization or fixed-share random assignment (without blocking)".</li>
        <li>Stratification (blocked or other) covers all stratification methods other than pure matched pair designs. If stratification is used in any part of randomization, select this option regardless of other methods used. Stratification serves to balance specific characteristics of the sample (covariates) across treatment arms. The sample is divided into subgroups ("strata") and fixed-share assignment are used within each stratum (the exact method may not be explicitly mentioned). In most papers, stratification will appear in the description of the randomization procedure and will use phrases such as "stratified by.." or "balanced the assignment by.." (e.g. "by gender") or "randomly assigned within" (e.g. "half of the households within each village were randomly chosen to receive…"). When blocked stratified randomization is used, the strata may themselves be the blocks (e.g. "block-randomized 5 sites per region..."). Note that stratification is sometimes also used in sampling, to ensure that each stratum is represented in the study Mark stratification here ONLY if the paper uses stratified randomization. Also note that, when randomization is done in stages, the second stage randomization may be stratified by the randomization results of the first stage. Please select this option if this is the case.</li>
        <li>Matched pair design is a specific type of stratified randomization. Here, randomization units are grouped into pairs ("matched") based on baseline characteristics, and within each pair, one unit is randomly assigned to the treatment and the other to the control. The term is typically explicitly used, but if the researchers describe the design as stratification where all strata are of size 2, please choose this option. If pair matching is used in addition to other stratification methods, please use "Stratification (blocked or other)".</li>
        <li>Covariate adaptive randomization is a method for balancing the sample across arms that applies if units of randomization arrive sequentially, such as patients at a clinic. It varies the assignment probability of each unit based on the covariate distribution among units that arrived previously. It typically attempts to minimize any covariate imbalance in random assignments.</li>
        <li>Re-randomization is another method to achieve balance. It consists of repeating a specific randomization procedure (e.g. simple or fixed-share random assignment) and selecting the "most balanced" assignment. The authors may conduct a pre-specified number of randomizations or re-randomize until a pre-specified balance criterion is met. Re-randomization is sometimes combined with stratification. In this case, select "Stratification (blocked or other)".</li>
        <li>Other or not specified Please use this category if the exact method of assignment is not specified, or if another assignment method is used, for example, adaptive sampling with objectives other than covariate balancing.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Descriptive example</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>In Andrew et al, 2018</strong> "Randomization was done at the level of a town and after a stratification by region" [Randomization and masking]. This indicates that towns were randomized in equal proportion to be assigned treatment or control arms Therefore, the response for this field would be "Stratification (blocked or other)".</li>
        <li><strong>In Stewart et al. (2020),</strong> the authors report that they "block-randomized 5 sites per treatment arm per region" into the five study arms. The correct answer is "Stratification (blocked or other)". Note that here the strata (the regions) are used as blocks.</li>

The correct answer here would be <strong>3</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>In Dupas (2011),</strong> the author notes that the randomization procedure is stratified by teacher training status. The correct answer here would be <strong>1</strong>.</li>

      <h3>Coding instructions for coders (Hint on SurveyCTO)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>List each of the stratification variables out in the order in which they appear in the paper.</li>
        <li>Use indicators for being assigned to an intervention (e.g. indicator for being assigned to provider incentive) if randomization at a lower level is stratified by groups generated by higher-level randomization of one or more other interventions.</li>
        <li>If local terms are used to define the strata - for example, woreda, oblast, union, or taluka - please retain the local term rather than using the author's translation of them into English.</li>
        <li>This information is mostly found in the randomization or methods section of the paper. Phrases such as "stratified by...", "randomly assigned within..." are common when describing stratification variables.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Descriptive example</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Since the response to 10 for Andrew et al, 2018 is Strata.</strong> Using text from the paper "Randomisation was done at the level of the cluster (town), after stratification by region. Within each of the 3 regions, 8 towns were randomly allocated to each of the 3 treatment groups and the control group using computer-generated random numbers" [Randomization and masking]. The response to this field would be "region" since that is the variable that makes up the strata as indicated in the paper.</li>
        <li><strong>In Freeman et al. (2022),</strong> authors use a stratified randomization design so the response to the previous question asking if the intervention was stratified is "Strata". The authors note "a stratified random design at the woreda-level was used to assign an equal number of study kebeles to either the Andilaye intervention or the control group receiving no intervention". The response to this question is "Woreda", as it is the local term used consistently throughout the paper.</li>

      </ul>
      <h3>Descriptive example</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>In Ozler et al, 2018,</strong> a "block randomization" was used to assign childcare centers in each district to the four study arms. "Centers were grouped based on mean height-for-age (HAZ) and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT - a measure of receptive vocabulary) z-scores, both of which were collected at baseline. The Ministry held a public lottery at each district capital where a representative from each center was asked to draw a colored dot from an envelope to determine that center's treatment status." The response to this question would be "Yes", as the same set of variables were used for stratification.</li>
        <li><strong>In Wolf et al. 2019,</strong> there are two stages of randomization. In the first stage, the intervention assignment was stratified by district and public/private status of the school. In the second stage, the interventions were assigned within groups created by treatment assignment in the first stage. The stratification variable is indicator for teacher training/parental awareness assignment. The response to this question would be "No", since the stratification variables are different across interventions.</li>

        <li>This information is mostly found in the randomization and methods sections of the paper. For most papers, this information will appear in the same paragraph as the one describing the stratification procedure.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Descriptive example</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wolf et al, 2018</strong> has 4 interventions and 5 study arms: Teacher training and coaching program; Parental awareness meetings; Text messages for teachers; Picture-based paper flyers or texts for parents. Based on the information in the section "Randomization", in a first stage of randomization, three of the interventions (teacher training and coaching program; and parental awareness meetings) were stratified by district and public/private status of the school. The text messages for teachers and the texts/flyers for parents were assigned in a second stage of randomization. These interventions were stratified by treatment assignment in the previous stage so that stratification variables for this assignment of interventions to arms would be indicators for being assigned to the two of the arms. So for this field, the stratification mapping for 5 study arms would be: Control - district and public/private status of the school; Teacher training and coaching program - district and public/private status of the school; Parental awareness meetings - district and public/private status of the school; Text messages for teachers - indicator for school being part of teacher training and coaching program; Picture-based paper flyers for parents - indicator for school being part of program with teacher training & coaching and parental awareness meetings</li>

        <li>Enter the total number of rounds of data collection reported in the paper, including baseline. A round collects data from the same data source at a given time. In other words, a round signals when different outcomes are measured.</li>
        <li>For studies in which data is only collected by surveys of subjects in the sample, the number of rounds typically aligns with the number of surveys (e.g., baseline, midline, endline = 3 rounds).</li>

Table 1 suggests that the register data was collected between September and December 2017. Appendix C indicates that the authors received "the up-to-date MAO and bank-based datasets at three points in time: once in July, once in August and once in September 2018. Therefore, there are seven rounds of data collection in the study. The response for this field is <strong>7</strong>.</li>

      <h3>Coding instructions for coders (Hint on SurveyCTO)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Label the round of data collection with descriptive names, such as "baseline", "midline", "midline phone survey", "endline", "one-year follow-up", "three-year follow up" etc.</li>
        <li>Retain any descriptive labels used by the study authors, such as "18-month follow up" or "23-month follow up."</li>
        <li>Use the data source to differentiate datasets collected at the same time, for example, phone survey at follow-up and census data at follow-up.</li>
        <li>This can be found in the "data collection" or "data sources" section for papers. Sometimes, papers have explanatory diagrams on timeline and implementation which coders can consult to get the different points of time in which data was collected. Tables with treatment effects can also illuminate the different rounds of data collection.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Descriptive example</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Freeman et al, 2022</strong> study collect household surveys and observations-based data at baseline, midline, and end line. [see: Data collection] Additionally, Figure 2 illuminates the points in time when each of the data collection rounds was conducted. The response for this field would be: Baseline, Midline, Endline</li>
        <li><strong>Ozler et al, 2018</strong> use three rounds of data collection [see: Data sources] The response for this field would be: Baseline, 18-month follow-up, 36-month follow-up</li>
        <li><strong>For Muralidharan et al. 2021,</strong> which draw on three administrative data sources and have seven total rounds, the round names would be: Register of landlords September – December 2017, Bank-based dataset July 2018, MAO record dataset July 2018, Bank-based dataset August 2018, MAO record dataset August 2018, Bank-based dataset September 2018, Mao record dataset September 2018</li>
        <li><strong>Pande & Field, 2008</strong> only use online endline data on loans and repayment in the current paper. The round name would be: Endline.</li>

      <h3>Coding instructions for coders (Hint on SurveyCTO)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>List the number of unique comparisons presented in the table. Any reported treatment effect is the result of a comparison of one group against another on an outcome, where a group can be a single study arm or a group of arms.</li>
        <li>In a case where there are 4 experimental groups (Treatment A, Treatment B, Treatment A+B, and a Control), many comparisons may be reported. We may see treatment effect for Treatment A relative to the Control, or we may see an estimate for the difference between Treatment A and the combination Treatment A+B. Understanding which comparison is being reported in a table or figure will be important if the row and column labels and table/figure notes do not contain this information.</li>
        <li>This information can be present either in the top row or column of a table or it may be reported in the rows as the variables for which treatment effects are being reported. The base arm for comparison is often the omitted category in a regression and/or mentioned in the footnotes of a table. Descriptions of each treatment effect in the results section can also illuminate the contrast under study for each estimate.</li>

        <li>List the number of distinct periods over which the treatments effects in the table were estimated. Periods refer to the units of time for which the paper reports treatment effects.</li>
        <li>Most times each period only involves one round of data collection. But authors may pool several rounds of data collection into one extended period for some analysis. [See examples in the Descriptive example column]</li>
        <li>When authors combine rounds of data collections, the number of periods in any given table may exceed the total number of rounds of data collection.</li>
        <li>In general, the baseline is not a period. This is because studies do not estimate the treatment effect at the time of the baseline survey/ However, if the authors use a difference-in-differences design to estimate the treatment effect, then the baseline is included in the period.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Descriptive example</h3>
      <p>In Hanna et al., 2016, table 3 presents 5 periods used to calculate treatment effects. The first row reports a period that includes all four rounds of midline and endline surveys in estimating the treatment effects. The following rows report the treatment effects in each individual period of midline and endline surveys (one per year since the treatment was administered). Coders should report "5" for this field, 1 each for the 4 separate yearly mid- and end-line surveys and 1 for the pooled endline.<br><br>
      In contrast, in Ozler et al, 2018, table 3,the title of the table specifies the results are for the 18-month follow up. Coders should report "1" for this field, as only one round of data collection was used in this table.</p>

        <li>Please identify and indicate the number of unique empirical specifications used to estimate treatment effects in the exhibit.</li>
        <li>A unique empirical specification is defined by the inclusion (or not) of strata correction, baseline outcome and other controls. This table illustrates all 8 types of specifications, and a coder should count how many of them were used to estimate treatment effect in the exhibit.</li>
        <li>Baseline value of outcome refers to the baseline value of the outcome for which the treatment effect is being estimated. Controls for baseline values of other variables are not included in baseline value of outcome.</li>
        <li>Controls include those are observed before treatment assignment refer to variables measured at baseline, as well as the ones that are measured after baseline but are considered to be static over the study period - for example, parental education in the context of a program targeting children, gender in the context of a program that is not assumed to affect gender identity, or residence in a flood-prone zone in a context of a program that is not assumed to affect choice of residence.</li>
        <li>A simple difference in means with no additional information on the specification used or the presence of any adjustment should be considered as "No other controls". Likewise, a regression with just the outcome of interest as the dependent variable and just an indicator for treatment status as the sole independent variable should be coded as "No other controls."</li>
        <li>Information on specifications can be found in both data and statistical analysis sections and table notes. In some papers, authors report the regression specification or empirical model used to estimate treatment effects and/or indicate their specification in column labels in tables. Sometimes, authors add additional details about specifications to table notes only. In other studies, this information must be inferred from the text and/or notes that accompany tables or figures.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Descriptive example</h3>
      <p>In Riley, 2024, E. The empirical Strategy describes the specifications in equation (1) that strata dummies and the baseline value of the outcome (if measured at baseline, otherwise excluded) are included in the estimation of treatment effects. In Table 1, where full sample results are reported, the notes indicate "All regressions include strata dummies and include the baseline value of the outcomes."<br><br>
      The response to this question is: 1<br><br>
      In Ashraf et al., 2010, according to tables notes, in Table 2, two specifications are used for each outcome: with and without baseline controls (including baseline Clorin usage and water cholorination, general health behaviors and attitudes, household demographics, and locality fixed effects).<br><br>
      The response to this question is: 2<br><br>
      Grossman and Baldassarri, 2012 report treatment effects using four set of specifications in Table 2 including no controls, individual controls, monitor profile (post-treatment control), and both individual controls and monitor profile. There are in total 4 specifications.<br><br>
      The response to this question is: 4</p>

<summary>Stage 2 Fields</summary>

<div style="padding: 1rem;">
  <p>This survey is going to go through each of the exhibits you specified in Stage 1 (and also verified by a supervisor) that reported treatment effects. The questions will allow us to match and specify the treatment effects that are eligible for data extraction for IDEAL.</p>
  <p>Section notes: Exhibit information</p>
  <p>In Stage 1, you reported that {Exhibit label} includes {Number of comparisons} contrast(s) and {Number of outcome variables in the table} outcome(s). In the next questions you will be asked to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Identify the IDEAL eligible treatment effect for each outcome-contrast pair.</li>
    <li>Describe the empirical specification and rounds of data collection used to estimate those treatment effects.</li>
  </ol>

    <p>How many IDEAL eligible treatment effects in the exhibit are you going to report?</p>
    <h3>Definition (LABEL on SurveyCTO)</h3>

    <h3>Response options</h3>
    <p>Numeric</p>
    <h3>CV (Choices on SurveyCTO)</h3>
    <p>Integer greater than zero</p>
    <h3>SurveyCTO instructions for data entry mask and repeat level</h3>
    <p>Repeat for each table identified in Stage 1.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Coding instructions for coders (Hint on SurveyCTO)</h3>
    <p>Count the number of IDEAL treatment effect estimates you plan to report for this exhibit.</p>
    <h3>What estimates to count</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>For each possible outcome-contrast pair, the total number of IDEAL-eligible treatment effects depends on the specification and the rounds of data collection.</li>
      <li>It is possible that no treatment effect is reported in the table for a given contrast-outcome pair. However, each outcome and contrast in the exhibit should be related to at least one treatment effect.</li>
      <li>Only count full sample results.</li>
      <li>Do not count estimates from interaction terms.</li>
      <li>Count ITT estimates. Only count LATE / TOT estimates if they are preferred by the author or they are the only estimates reported.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to count data collection rounds</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If treatment effects are estimated for multiple rounds of data collection, count each round as a separate treatment effect.</li>
      <li>For example, if the same treatment effect is estimated separately for the "first follow-up survey" and the "second follow-up survey," each estimate should be counted as a distinct treatment effect, regardless of the specification used.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to count specifications</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>When multiple treatment effects are reported for a contrast-outcome pair, only two of them will be eligible for IDEAL:</li>
      <li>IDEAL-preferred specification: Count the treatment effects estimated using the highest-ranked IDEAL-preferred specification.</li>
      <li>Author-preferred specification: Only count the author-preferred specification as separate treatment effect if it differs from the IDEAL-preferred specification.</li>
      <li>The ranking of IDEAL-preferred specifications can be found here (click to open new page): <a href="https://ideal-consortium.github.io/Schema/IDEAL_Ranking_Index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ideal-consortium.github.io/Schema/IDEAL_Ranking_Index.html</a></li>

  <p>In this section, please describe the details of each intervention you specified in Stage 1.</p>
  <p>It is possible that information in the paper about the intervention may be spread across different sections of the paper. This information may be located in paper sections such as the introduction or those that discuss research design or experimental design, including the footnotes.</p>
  <p>When extracting information verbatim from the paper, please add quotation marks around the words and include the page number. Use square brackets for any paraphrased text or spelled out acronyms in the quotation.</p>
  <p>For example, "The Andilaye intervention focused on three WASH [Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene]-related behavioral themes, informed by formative research: (1) sanitation, (2) personal hygiene, and (3) household environmental sanitation. Within these themes were 11 constituent practices targeted by the intervention; these practices were identified through formative research as ones that could be targeted using demand-side approaches, and were seen as achievable, per stakeholder feedback."

    <p>One intervention in Lyall et al. 2020 is a technical and vocational education training program, and a description of the intervention would be:</p>
    <p>The intervention consisted of three livelihood training components bundled together. "First, participants were enrolled in either three- or six-month TVET [Technical and Vocational Education and Training] courses at one of four VTCs. These courses ranged from motorcycle and mobile phone repair to metal works and computer services to tailoring and English-language tutoring. While content was trade-specific, each course aimed to build practical marketable skills and to improve prospects for full-time employment in the local economy. Second, students were concurrently enrolled in a "soft skills" course designed to bolster business skills and employment opportunities by networking with key local market actors. As part of this course, participants received instruction in time management, decision-making, leadership, and negotiation. Third, participants who successfully completed technical TVET courses were provided with a small start-up kit of trade-specific tools upon graduation.(p130)"</p>
    <p>A description of the phone-monitoring intervention in Muralidharan et al. 2021 could be:</p>
    <p>"The call center placed calls to the mobile phone numbers of sampled farmers. If a call did not connect, the call center would attempt to reach that number up to five more times over the following two days before giving up. If connected, the call center operator verified the respondent's identity and identified themselves as conducting a survey on behalf of the Government of Telangana to understand the respondent's experience with the Rythu Bandhu Scheme. Calls collected information on whether, where, and when the farmer received their check; whether and when they encashed it; any problems receiving or encashing the check (including time costs and bribes); how they used the funds; suggestions for future rounds of RBS; and overall satisfaction with RBS [Rythu Bandhu Scheme].

    <h3>Instruction for coders (This will go to the "Hints" for surveyCTO)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Please describe any criteria applied to determine if an individual or unit is eligible (or ineligible) for the intervention such as age limits, qualification criteria, etc.</li>
      <li>Note that eligibility for the intervention can overlap with but is generally distinct from the inclusion/exclusion criteria applied when sampling units or observations for data collection</li>
      <li>Eligibility for the intervention may be broader than the sampling inclusion/exclusion criteria (e.g. sampling may be restricted to a certain set of districts the intervention was implemented in more districts), or narrower (e.g. while income of all household members is measured, the intervention is a cash transfer for women 15-45 years of age.)</li>
      <li>Nonetheless, often, recruitment into the study sample uses the eligibility criteria for the intervention. In this case, please repeat the information here. For example, in an early childhood health intervention the study may sample households or women with at least one child under 5, but the intervention targets children under 5.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Descriptive examples for coding</h3>
    <p>There were three sets of eligibility criteria for the two iron interventions in Pasricha et al., 2021.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>"Children 7.5 to 8.5 months of age" (p983) were eligible.</li>
      <li>"Children with marked anemia (a hemoglobin level of <8.0 g per deciliter), current febrile illness, severe acute malnutrition, a known inherited red-cell disorder or previous transfusion, or known developmental delay were excluded" (p983).</li>
      <li>Children in households with iron levels in drinking water exceeding 1 mg per liter were excluded.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The eligibility criteria for the conditional cash transfer intervention in Filmer et al. 2023 were described as "Households are eligible if they have a proxy means test score below the provincial poverty line and contain children ages 0 to 14 years or a pregnant woman" (p329).</p>
    <p>Note that in this paper, the eligibility criteria for the intervention were narrower than the sampling inclusion/exclusion criteria as the sample included ineligible households as well.</p>
    <p>In Lyall et al. 2020, both interventions in the INVEST programs targeted "at-risk youth" and "internally displaced persons". The paper noted that the recruitment was done by a consortium of actors but there were no data on "individuals who were deemed ineligible for participation" (p132).</p>
    <p>So, the eligibility criteria for the two interventions should be "At-risk youth and internally displaced persons".</p>

    </ol>
    <p>These criteria apply to both interventions (i.e. Iron syrup and Micronutrient powders) in the paper, so the answer would be "Yes".</p>
    <p>In Banerjee et al, 2016, there are four interventions: (1) Summer camp, (2) learning materials, (3) teacher training, and (4) volunteer support.</p>
    <p>The eligibility criteria for "Summer camp" are "academically weak children in grades 3-5",</p>
    <p>While the eligibility criteria for the other interventions are "children in grades 1-5".</p>

      <li>Select "yes" if the program was only scaled up after the study implementation.</li>
      <li>No: the intervention was implemented at a larger scale than the evaluated treatment group either before the study or during the same time period, for example, when a large-scale intervention took place but only a portion of it was being evaluated for various reasons. This could be the case for government implemented programs at scale, or for existing programs where one roll-out wave of a larger program or a subset of "marginal candidates" are used for randomized evaluation.</li>

    <h3>Descriptive examples for coding</h3>
    <p>Crost, Felter, and Johnston (2016) evaluated part of a conditional cash transfer program (Pantawid Pamilya) in the Philippines. In 2019, the program was scheduled to begin in 19 municipalities of 8 provinces. Among the 19 municipalities, 8 were randomly selected to be part of the evaluated experiment. The remaining received the intervention as scheduled.</p>
    <p>In this case, the scale of the implemented intervention was larger than the treatment group in the experiment.</p>
    <p>So, the response to this question would be "No, intervention scale larger than study scale".</p>
    <p>In Mbiti et al. (2019), the interventions were implemented at the school level, affecting all students in the focal grades. The study only collected data from a randomly selected group of students and households and included them in the analysis. Specifically, 10 students from each focal grade were sampled and 10 households were selected from each school for data collection. [See III.B.Data]</p>
    <p>Therefore, the scale of the implemented intervention was larger than the study sample. The response would be "No, intervention scale larger than study scale".</p>

      <li>Please summarize any information on whether the implementation of the intervention deviated from original plans or differed in any way from the typical or at-scale implementation.</li>
      <li>Write "not stated" if there is no information on implementation fidelity.</li>
      <li>Write "as planned" if there is explicit information that the intervention was exactly implemented as planned.</li>
      <li>Note that implementation fidelity is distinct from "compliance" (whether the treatment assignment is respected) and "take-up" (whether a treated unit chooses not to take up a correctly offered treatment).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Descriptive examples for coding</h3>
    <p>Andrew et al., 2018 mentioned a fidelity issue of the intervention: "Unfortunately, FeA [Familias en Accion] lacked capacity in ECD and could only assist in identifying participants and Madres Lideres but not supervisors, who we therefore hired from Bogota. The intervention covered a vast area, and supervisors had to travel large distances to meet the Madres Lideres. Therefore, the frequency of contacts was planned for once every 6 weeks, compared to weekly in Jamaica, but in practice averaged once every 9 weeks. After the initial 6-week training, supervisors themselves had little support, apart from 2 refresher workshops. The only criterion for selection of Madres Lideres was their ability to read. Although Reach Up was designed for use with home visitors with low educational levels, it was intended for them to have frequent coaching and support from supervisors, with ideally weekly contacts."

The definition should be understandable for someone who has not read the paper and does not necessarily know what the intervention is.</li>

    <h3>Descriptive examples for coding</h3>
    <p>In Muralidharan et al. 2021, one outcome variable is listed as "Ever encashed" in the tables (from Table 3). The outcome variable measured whether a farmer ever encashed a benefit check during the valid period. Therefore, a response to this field would be "Encashed the program benefit check". The unit does not need to be specified here because it will be clear from the unit of analysis field.</p>
    <p>One outcome variable of Table 4 in Barrera-Osorio et al. 2022 is "Total Scores". The test scores were language and math combined for all children aged 5 to 10 measured at the second follow-up. So, an answer to this field would be "Language and math combined test score for children aged 5 to 10, measured 1.5 years after school in operation". The target population unit needs to be mentioned in this case as the age restriction may not be obvious from the unit of analysis - child.</p>
    <p>In Chong et al., 2015, one outcome variable in Table 4 is "Turnout". The table notes indicate that the outcome variable refers to "total number of votes divided by number of registered voters multiplied by 100". Therefore, one response to this field would be "Registered voter turnout (percentage)".</p>

      <li>A binary outcome variable is a variable that has only two possible values. Binary variables are often – but not always – categorical variables. Binary variables that describe categories are most often coded as 0 and 1. They may also be called indicator or dummy variables. For example, sex (male/female) or currently attending school (yes/no) are both binary variables and may be coded as, say, 1 for women and 0 for men, or 1 for yes and 0 for no.</li>
      <li>Note this field is about the variable that enters the estimation, not how the input variable may have been originally measured. For example, the average of multiple 0/1 binary variables represents a fraction and is not a binary variable itself, even though the underlying data is binary – take the example of the outcome variable "average school attendance over the school year (in share of school days)", constructed from a series of 0/1 indicators for every school day whether the child was present in the classroom.</li>
      <li>Conversely, if an outcome measure was collected as a non-binary variable but transformed into a binary variable when estimating the treatment effect, it should be considered a binary outcome variable. For example, suppose educational attainment was measured with a multiple choice question (i.e. 1=primary education or less, 2=lower secondary education, 3=upper secondary education, and 4=post-secondary education), but in the estimation, the outcome was transformed into an indicator for "has a post-secondary education". The response to this question should be "No" for the school attendance example, but "Yes" for the education level example.</li>
      <li>Treatment effect estimates for binary outcome variables may use linear probability, probit or logit models.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Descriptive examples for coding</h3>
    <p>In Sukhtankar et al., 2022, the authors measure DIRs, or Domestic Incident Reports, which represent civil complaints of domestic violence. This is the count of DIRs in a given time period at a given police station.</p>
    <p>The response to this field would be No.</p>
    <p>In Cheema et al., 2022, for the measure of women's voter turnout is a variable which is coded as 1 if the respondent voted, and 0 if the respondent did not vote (operationalized by observing the ink from voting day on the respondent's thumb).</p>
    <p>The response to this field would be Yes.</p>
    <p>In Freeman et al., 2022, "Poor well-being" is a binary variable. Please note that the variable was dichotomized from a continuous well-being score, "with scores below 13 indicating poor well-being".</p>
    <p>Because the variable entering the estimation is a binary variable, the response to this field would be "Yes".</p>

    <p>For the outcome "Younger than 23 months preventive visit, previous 4 weeks" in Basinga et al, 2011, the previous answers could be:</p>
    <p>Outcome variable definition: Child visited a health facility for preventive care.</p>
    <p>Unit of analysis: Child aged 23 months or younger</p>
    <p>Target population: N/A</p>
    <p>Time reference period: 4 weeks</p>
    <p>The suggested short description will read: Child visited a health facility for preventive care over a 4 week period (Child aged 23 months or younger)</p>
    <p>Step 1: correct outcome variable definition: this text should not contain the unit of analysis, and it should be clear if it counts number of visits or measures whether any visit took place. Example, change it to "Any visit to a health facility for preventive care".</p>
    <p>Step 2: revise the short description for conciseness, grammar, and clarity. New short text is: "Any visit to a health facility for preventive care over a 4 week period (Child aged 23 months or younger)"</p>
    <p>Final version might be: "Any preventive care health facility visit over a 4-week period (Children under 2 years of age)"</p>

      <li>It is possible that this information may not exist at the study arm level or for some of the study arms. If this is the case, enter "-99" in the corresponding field if the information cannot be found in the paper.</li>
      <li>This information is mostly found in the research design sections of the paper, specifically in the description of the random assignment, which is sometimes included in a separate sub-section of the paper. The information may also be found in participant flow diagrams (e.g. the CONSORT flow diagram) or a table that disaggregates information by treatment arms, such as a balance table, or even a treatment effects table, especially if the randomization unit and the unit of analysis are identical.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Descriptive examples for coding</h3>
    <p>In Lyall et al, 2020, the number of units assigned to each study reatment arm is available in the paper. See Figure 2 in Randomization Section. The coder would input the following for each treatment arm, which was identified in Stage 1:</p>
    <p>TVET treatment and UCT treatment: 313</p>
    <p>TVET treatment and UCT control: 312</p>
    <p>TVET treatment and Non-UCT Group: 673</p>
    <p>TVET control and UCT treatment:273</p>
    <p>TVET control and UCT control: 270</p>
    <p>TVET control and Non-UCT Group: 756</p>
    <p>In Badrinathan 2021, the number of units assigned to each study arm is only available for the control arms (n = 406). The author does note that an equal proportion were assigned to each of the three treatment arms but does not provide an exact number for the two treatment arms.</p>
    <p>Thus, a coder would put "-99" to indicate the number of units does not exist for treatment arm 1 and treatment arm 2, and provide "406" for the control arm.</p>
    <p>For the "call to action" intervention in Garbiras-Diaz and Montenegro 2022, the number of units assigned to each arm is presented in Figure 1 (Randomization Design) as follows:</p>
    <p>Placebo Control Group: 225</p>

    <h3>Instruction for coders (This will go to the "Hints" for surveyCTO)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>For each treatment arm, compliance refers to any treatment unit that received the treatment as intended. The unit does not need to have taken the full treatment or have taken up the offered treatment to be considered in compliance.</li>
      <li>Sometimes compliance is not separately reported from take up. Non-compliance should only capture cases where a mistake in the randomization led to the treatment not being offered, or offered to the wrong units. In all other cases, record compliance as "not available."</li>
      <li>For the status quo control group, authors may refer to spillover or treatment contamination and report the share who received a treatment (the non-compliance rate), rather than the share who correctly did not receive the treatment (the compliance rate). Please always report the compliance rate.</li>
      <li>Please enter fraction in this field, for example, 15/16 indicating 15 out of 15 randomization units complied with the treatment status or 49/100 for a compliance rate of 49%.</li>
      <li>Enter "-99" if the information is not mentioned in the paper.</li>
      <li>Enter "-88" if compliance rate cannot be entered as numeric values. Please specify the details.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Descriptive examples for coding</h3>
    <p>In Bos et al., 2024, the authors discussed the compliance issue of the treatment arms in [4.2. Receipt and use of program materials by households]. "As per the intervention guidelines, households in the treatment group should have received four materials: a child development card, a household picture book, a nature picture book, and a key message booklet. However, Table 6 shows that due to imperfect compliance, the differential likelihood of receipt of the child development card, household picture book, and nature picture book between treatment and control households was approximately 49 percentage points (instead of 100 under perfect compliance). Furthermore, 2%–3% of households in the control group received these materials."</p>
    <p>In this example, although "imperfect compliance" is used to describe the fact that only 49% of treatment households received the intervention materials. That was actually a result of low implementation fidelity rather than non-compliance to assigned treatment status.</p>
    <p>However, the receipt of materials by the control households was a non-compliance issue as they were not assigned to get the intervention (i.e. materials).</p>
    <p>Therefore, the answers to this field would be,</p>
    <p>for the treatment study arm, "-99";</p>
    <p>for the control study arm, "-88" and then enter "2%–3% of households in the control group received these materials" in the open-text field.</p>

    <p>In Brudevold-Newman et al., 2024: 'Just over 61 percent of those assigned to the franchise treatment attended at least one day of business training (which was the first component of the franchise treatment), and 44 percent completed the program and launched a business.' (page 8)</p>
    <p>In this question, we want the proportion of a treatment that participated in 'some proportion of treatment' (i.e. take-up), so the answer will then be 61%. For the grant arm, in Table A2 [Compliance and Attrition] from appendix [column: Grant], we see that 95% of the grant arm received the grant.</p>
    <p>Although both the section in the paper and the appendix Table A2 were titled "Compliance and Attrition". The "compliance" rates for the treatment groups were technically "take-up" rates.</p>
    <p>Therefore, the response would be:</p>
    <p>Take-up for franchise arm: 61.</p>
    <p>Take-up for grant arm: 95.</p>

      <li>Typically, the authors will state if an outcome is an index. Sometimes an index may be called a "score".</li>
      <li>If an outcome is constructed from multiple independently measured variables or indicators that are not in the same domain, assess different dimensions of the same concept, or do not share the same unit, it is an index variable. An index typically does not have a unit.</li>
      <li>For example, household income (say, in Rupees) as the sum of all individual incomes in the household is not an index, but an early childhood development score combining assessments of math and behavioral skills is an index.</li>
      <li>Index aggregation of multiple variables may involve adding values, taking an average, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Descriptive examples for coding</h3>
    <p>Banerjee et al., 2019, describe the outcome variable "HIV knowledge" explicitly as an index. The indicators that enter the index are also presented. "HIV knowledge measures how aware an individual is of the methods of transmission, the availability of drugs, and the timing of testing for HIV. Higher values of this index correspond to greater awareness."</p>
    <p>The response to this question would be "Yes".</p>
    <p>In Barrera-Osorio et al, 2011, one outcome is "monitored school attendance rate" (Table 3). According to the authors, "We collected attendance data during the last quarter of 2005 through direct observation. For this purpose, the team assembled a group of assistants who randomly visited schools and classes. The assistants directly called the roll of all students, and students were marked absent if they were not physically present in the classroom." [C. Data]. This variable is constructed from many separate observations, but it does not combine multiple alternative methods of measuring attendance for the same student, so it is not an index.</p>
    <p>The response to this question would be "No".</p>
    <p>In Wolf et al., 2019, "Teacher motivation" is an index outcome although it is not called an index. The "Measures" section mentioned that "Teacher's motivation was measured using five items adapted from Bennell and Akyeampong (2007) as reported in Wolf, Aber et al. (2015)." There are multiple components in the outcome variable, thus it is an index outcome.</p>
    <p>The response to this question would be "Yes".</p>
    <p>In Barrera-Osorio et al., 2022, "Total score" is an index outcome consisting of language score and math score. The paper does not explicitly state that the variable is an index. However, the Data section stated that children were tested on language and math, so we can infer that "Total score" is an index.</p>
    <p>The response to this question would be "Yes".</p>

    <p>In Freeman et al. 2022 (Table 3), the outcome variable "Water and sanitation insecurity scores: Water – HWISE Scale" is an index outcome. The "Outcome of Interest" section and table notes describe the details of the variable.</p>
    <p>One answer to this field would be "Water insecurity was measured through the Household Water Insecurity Experiences (HWISE) scale. HWISE includes 12 items with four response categories (never, rarely, sometimes, often/always). The score is the sum of responses, ranging from 0–36. A higher score indicates greater household water insecurity."</p>
    <p>In Barrera-Osorio et al., 2022, "Total score" is an index outcome consisting of language score and math score. Both components were also outcome variables.. The information in the paper on the "Total score" suggests it is simply the sum of the two scores.</p>

    <p>Here the tool used for each outcome is:</p>
    <p>Literacy: Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) (Gove&Wetterbery, 2011).</p>
    <p>Mental health: Centers for Epidemiological Studies‐Depression scale CES‐D (Radloff, 1977).</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Please first determine whether the outcome variable is standardized or not. If standardized, choose the type of standardization.</li>
      <li>An outcome is standardized if it is converted from the original values to a z-score using mean and standard deviation.</li>
      <li>If an outcome variable is standardized using the mean and standard deviation of any group of the study sample, then it is internally standardized, for example, using the control group distribution.</li>
      <li>If an outcome variable is standardized using the distribution of a normative sample outside the study sample, it is externally standardized. For example, anthropometric measures for children under five years of age, such as Weight-for-Height or Arm Circumference, or the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) are standardized externally using a reference group at "typical" level of development.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Descriptive examples for coding</h3>
    <p>For the outcome variable "Weight for age Z-score" in Table 2 of Pickering et al. (2019), the standardization is external because it uses the WHO child growth reference distribution.</p>
    <p>The response to this field would be "Externally standardized".</p>
    <p>In Leaver et al. (2021), "Student learning" in Table 3 was internally standardized. Table 2 notes suggest that "student learning IRT scores are standardized based on the distribution in the experienced FW [Fixed-wage contract] arm".</p>

      <li>Yes: the scale of the evaluated intervention and the implemented intervention were the same. This is usually the case for researcher implemented programs or pilot programs.</li>
      <li>Select "yes" if the program was only scaled up after the study implementation.</li>
      <li>No: the intervention was implemented at a larger scale than the evaluated treatment group either before the study or during the same time period, for example, when a large-scale intervention took place but only a portion of it was being evaluated for various reasons.

    <p>One answer could be "There are three components in the intervention. The TVET courses were either three months or six months long. The duration of the "soft-skill" course was not stated. The third component was a start-up kit of trade-specific tools."</p>
    <p>The "Early Education Program (Programa Educación Inicial or PEI)" in Cardenas, Evans and Holland (2023) was an early childhood education intervention that included 65 group sessions during nine months with each session lasting for about 2 hours.</p>
    <p>One answer could be "The intervention included 65 group sessions during a nine-month term. 'These sessions included (1) up to 26 sessions for caregivers and parents (men and women), (2) up to 18 sessions for caregivers and parents (men and women) focused on children, (3) up to 5 sessions for parents who are men, and (4) up to 8 sessions for pregnant women. In addition, promotoras [facilitators who receive two weeks of annual training, educational materials, and a small stipend] could organize up to 8 additional sessions for diagnosis, planning, and evaluation.' 'Sessions were generally held for two hours, and the frequency of these sessions is defined through an initial agreement between the promotoras and participants, often one or more times per week between the sessions of type (a) and (b).'"

    <p>Andrew et al., 2018 mentioned a fidelity issue of the intervention: "Unfortunately, FeA [Familias en Accion] lacked capacity in ECD and could only assist in identifying participants and Madres Lideres but not supervisors, who we therefore hired from Bogota. The intervention covered a vast area, and supervisors had to travel large distances to meet the Madres Lideres. Therefore, the frequency of contacts was planned for once every 6 weeks, compared to weekly in Jamaica, but in practice averaged once every 9 weeks. After the initial 6-week training, supervisors themselves had little support, apart from 2 refresher workshops. The only criterion for selection of Madres Lideres was their ability to read. Although Reach Up was designed for use with home visitors with low educational levels, it was intended for them to have frequent coaching and support from supervisors, with ideally weekly contacts."

      <li>A binary outcome variable is a variable that has only two possible values. Binary variables are often – but not always – categorical variables. Binary variables that describe categories are most often coded as 0 and 1. They may also be called indicator or dummy variables. For example, sex (male/female) or currently attending school (yes/no) are both binary variables and may be coded as, say, 1 for women and 0 for men, or 1 for yes and 0 for no.</li>
      <li>Note this field is about the variable that enters the estimation, not how the input variable may have been originally measured. For example, the average of multiple 0/1 binary variables represents a fraction and is not a binary variable itself, even though the underlying data is binary – take the example of the outcome variable "average school attendance over the school year (in share of school days)", constructed from a series of 0/1 indicators for every school day whether the child was present in the classroom.</li>
      <li>Conversely, if an outcome measure was collected as a non-binary variable but transformed into a binary variable when estimating the treatment effect, it should be considered a binary outcome variable. For example, suppose educational attainment was measured with a multiple choice question (i.e. 1=primary education or less, 2=lower secondary education, 3=upper secondary education, and 4=post-secondary education), but in the estimation, the outcome was transformed into an indicator for "has a post-secondary education". The response to this question should be "No" for the school attendance example, but "Yes" for the education level example.</li>
      <li>Treatment effect estimates for binary outcome variables may use linear probability, probit or logit models.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In Freeman et al. 2022 (Table 3), the outcome variable "Water and sanitation insecurity scores: Water – HWISE Scale" is an index outcome. The "Outcome of Interest" section and table notes describe the details of the variable.</p>
    <p>One answer to this field would be "Water insecurity was measured through the Household Water Insecurity Experiences (HWISE) scale. HWISE includes 12 items with four response categories (never, rarely, sometimes, often/always). The score is the sum of responses, ranging from 0–36. A higher score indicates greater household water insecurity."</p>
    <p>In Barrera-Osorio et al., 2022, "Total score" is an index outcome consisting of language score and math score. Both components were also outcome variables. The information in the paper on the "Total score" suggests it is simply the sum of the two scores.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>This question refers to the meaning of the numeric values of the outcome.</li>
      <li>Cardinal: The values of a cardinal outcome variable are used to count and measure the amount of the outcome. A cardinal outcome variable is either a number quantity or has a unit attached, such as a currency. Levels and differences between two values of a cardinal variable can be interpreted in a meaningful way. Examples are a person's weight (in kg) and height (in cm). Ratios and percentages are also cardinal variables, such as the share of female landowners. Even an odds ratio and a z-score are cardinal because the level and differences between values are interpretable.</li>
      <li>Ordinal: An ordinal variable is typically a scale, rank, or position in a sequence, and its values have a natural rank or order. The level of an ordinal outcome or the difference between two values cannot be interpreted in a numerical way. Ordinal outcomes are often collected as responses to subjective questions about preferences. A Likert scale is ordinal. For example, satisfaction with public service (coded 1-satisfied, 2 – neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, and 3 – dissatisfied) is an ordinal outcome variable.</li>
      <li>Categorical (or nominal): The values of a categorical variable indicate labels or categories and cannot be ordered. An example is a variable that describes a choice between buying different types of goods that are not naturally "ordered" by price or quality (0 – bought nothing, 1 – bought good A, 2—bought good B). Non-binary categorical outcome variables are very rare because the average of such a variable is meaningless. The estimation method associated with a non-binary categorical outcome variable would be typically some form of discrete choice model (e.g. multinomial probit or logit). If you choose this option for an outcome variable, please also flag this field for review.</li>
      <li>Be sure to select the answer to this field based on the outcome variable type that entered the estimation. This may be different from the outcome measure in the data collection. For example, a categorical variable with more than two categories may be converted into a set of binary variables. In the example above, the authors may estimate treatment effects on variable A (0- did not buy good A, 1- bought good A) and variable B (0- did not buy good B, 1 – bought good B). If so, please describe those two binary variables A and B rather than the original variable measured.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Descriptive examples for coding</h3>
    <p>In Chong et al. 2015, one outcome variable in Table 4 is "Incumbent party votes/Reg. Voters", representing "the number of votes for the incumbent party divided by the registered voters and multiplied by 100". This is a cardinal variable because it is a percentage.</p>
    <p>In Ozler et al. 2018, the "Total Enrollment (reported)" outcome variable in Table 6 measured the average number of children enrolled in each childcare center. It is a cardinal variable.</p>
    <p>In Aker, Collier and Vicent 2017, one outcome variable is "Any problem: Intensity (0-5)". It was" a measure of the intensity of problems by classifying each problematic polling location in terms of the most serious problem that it had: we apply the scale of 1 to 5 we described above, from minor problems to occurrences resulting in homicides, with polling locations that had no electoral problems given a score of 0." The measure was constructed by the authors with five categories: "1 corresponds to minor problems; 2 corresponds to nonviolent occurrences, including campaign misconduct and election day problems; 3 corresponds to occurrences leading to physical intimidation, including vandalism; 4 corresponds to occurrences resulting in injured people; and 5 corresponds to occurrences resulting in deaths."</p>
    <p>This is an ordinal variable because it measures the intensity of problems at polling locations using a scale.</p>

Instruction for coders (This will go to the “Hints” for surveyCTO)	- Include any additional information about the outcome variable that is found in the paper and not recorded elsewhere, including its construction or processing (such as winsorizing or imputation of missing values), validation and quality control (such as double entry or back checks), measurement (such as exact procedures for an educational test conducted), etc. 
Descriptive examples for coding	In Haushofer and Shapiro (2016), the “Value of nonland assets (US$)” (in Table VI) variable was “top-coded for the highest 1% of observations”. This detail was not covered by any of the previous fields. The coder should include it in this field. 
 
The response to this field would be “Top-coded for the highest 1% of observations.”

Create calculated fields using answers from previous questions and display them as prompts for this field: 
“Outcome variable definition” 
 “Unit of analysis” + “Unit of analysis inclusion criteria”
“Time reference period”
Present an editable open-text field  that is pre-filled in the following format:
[Outcome name] [over a reference period] ([Unit of analysis], [Unit of analysis inclusion criteria]) 
Instruction for coders (This will go to the “Hints” for surveyCTO)	-Please provide a short description of the outcome variable that includes the key information collected on this outcome in an easily readable format following the schema
[Outcome name] [over a reference period] ([Unit of analysis], [Unit of analysis inclusion criteria]) 
- The suggested format is prefilled. Please review and verify the information you previously completed, then, if necessary, modify the text of the short description to make it grammatical, readable, and concise. Only in rare cases (e.g. the description is excessively long or the reference period is unusual, etc.) should the short description need a lot of editing. 
Descriptive examples for coding	For the outcome “Younger than 23 months preventive visit, previous 4 weeks” in Basinga et al, 2011, the previous answers could be:
Outcome variable definition: Child visited a health facility for preventive care. 
Unit of analysis: Child aged 23 months or younger
Target population: N/A
Time reference period: 4 weeks
The suggested short description will read:
Child visited a health facility for preventive care over a 4 week period (Child aged 23 months or younger)
Step 1: correct outcome variable definition: this text should not contain the unit of analysis, and it should be clear if it counts number of visits or measures whether any visit took place. Example, change it to “Any visit to a health facility for preventive care”.
Step 2: revise the short description for conciseness, grammar, and clarity.
 New short text is:
“Any visit to a health facility for preventive care over a 4 week period (Child aged 23 months or younger)”
 Final version might be:
“Any preventive care health facility visit over a 4-week period (Children under 2 years of age)”

<summary>Stage 3 Module 2: Estimates</summary>

<div style="padding: 1rem;">
  <p><strong>Section notes:</strong> This section will go through each of the treatment effects confirmed in Stage 2 to collect the estimates of treatment effects. A treatment effect is defined by the outcome variable (that enters estimation), the comparison between the evaluation arm and the reference arm, the estimand, the empirical specification, and the periods (the data rounds used for the estimation and, if relevant, how they are pooled). Please review the pre-loaded information on the treatment effect carefully before answering the estimate questions.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Instructions for data entry mask:</strong> This set of questions on estimates should loop through each treatment effect confirmed in Stage 2. The preloaded prompts for coders include: [Exhibit number], [Outcome name], [Unit of analysis], [Eval arm], [Reference arm], [Estimand], [Empirical specifications], [Period (including rounds)]. This information needs to be presented for every treatment effect at the beginning of the estimate questions.</p>

    <h3>Descriptive examples for coding</h3>
    <p>In Wolf et al., 2019, the "Impact analysis" section (page 23) suggests that "multi-level modeling" was used to estimate the treatment effects on child, teacher and classroom outcomes. So, we can assume "multi-level or hierarchical model/regression" is the estimation model for all treatment effects in the paper, unless it is specified otherwise for a particular case.</p>
    <p>Table 4 reports treatment effects for teach-level and classroom-level outcomes. Footnote "a" suggests that "teacher turnover" treatment effects were estimated with multinomial logistic regressions. Thus, for those treatment effects, the estimation model should be "Logistic regression", while for the rest in the same table, the answer should be "multi-level or hierarchical model/regression".</p>
    <p>In Ara et al., 2019, Table 3 presents group means by study arm and the p-value associated with the group mean difference without directly reporting the mean difference. In this case, a coder should select "T-test (mean-comparison test)" for treatment effects in the table.</p>

    <h3>Instruction for coders (This will go to the "Hints" for surveyCTO)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>For each estimate, select the null hypothesis that was tested.</li>
      <li>Look in the sections on theory, empirical strategy, and results to check if the author(s) have different theoretical priors around the null hypothesis.</li>
      <li>Also note that oftentimes authors report alternative hypotheses the most prominently; it is important here that we are referring to the null hypothesis.</li>
      <li>In most cases where the authors often do not explicitly state the null hypothesis, the null is equal to either 0 for non-binary dependent variables, or 1 for binary dependent variables. In other cases, the paper should have an explicit discussion about the hypotheses being tested. If you are not sure about your answer, please flag it in the request-for-review section.</li>
      <li>Null=0: The null hypothesis is that the difference between the two groups in the outcome variable is 0. For non-binary dependent variables, this suggests there is no treatment effect.</li>
      <li>Null= 1: The null hypothesis is that the difference between the two groups in the outcome variable is 1. For odds ratio, that means the odds of the outcome are the same in both the treatment group and the control group, indicating no difference. Therefore, if an outcome is measured in odds ratio, risk ratio or hazard ratio, the null hypothesis is often equal to 1.</li>
      <li>Null=constant: If the authors report that the null hypothesis is that the treatment effect is equal to a constant other than 0 or 1.</li>

      <li>However, sometimes, a treatment effect is calculated using a linear combination of more than coefficients in the same regression model. This is often seen in an RCT with a factorial design. If that's the case, please select the number of coefficients needed to calculate the treatment effect and enter the details of each of them in the following questions.</li>
      <li>Read the regression tables and the results section closely to understand which coefficients correspond to the specified treatment effect.</li>

    <h3>Descriptive examples for coding</h3>
    <p>In Table 3 of Leaver et al, 2021, there are treatment effects on student learning reported for four comparisons over three periods: Pooled, Year 1, and Year 2. Taking the Pooled period as an example, the treatment effects for different comparisons were reported in various coefficients.</p>
    <p>The first comparison was between the group that was recruited through an advertisement for the pay-for-performance contract (P4P) but placed in a fixed-wage (FW) contract and the group that was recruited through the FW advertisement and placed in the same contract (i.e the comparison between a & b in Figure 1). [Note that this information has been confirmed in Stage 2 and presented as part of the prompt for the treatment effect.]</p>
    <p>The treatment effect of that comparison on learning over the pooled period is presented in row 1, column 1 under Model A, as explained in the paper (p 2234). There is only one coefficient corresponding to this treatment effect, so the answer would be 1 to this field.</p>
    <p>Another comparison was between the two groups that both applied under the P4P advertisement, but one got the P4P contract but the other received an FW contract (i.e. the comparison between b & d in Figure 1).</p>
    <p>The treatment effect for that comparison should be a linear combination of row 2 and row 3 under Model B in Table 3 (see p 2235). Thus, the answer to this field would be 2.</p>

  <h3>Section notes for precision statistics</h3>
  <p>We need several precision statistics to standardize effect sizes using reported treatment effects. The survey will guide you to help extract a sequence of precision values, and it will stop once the minimum set of values are captured. The information on the type of precision statistics and the value is often found in the notes in tables that report the treatment effects in the main paper or in the appendix. It is possible that different precision values for the same treatment effect are reported in various parts of the paper. Please check both the main paper and the appendix carefully.</p>
  
  <p><strong>For continuous variable:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>We always get the SE and t-stat. If both present, we stop.</li>
    <li>If either one is missing, we pick up the p-value (not adjusted for multiple inference) which can be used in combination with other fields to back out SE and t-stat.</li>
    <li>If none of them are present, pick up the CI and the significance level, and F-ratio for one-way ANCOVA.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>For binary variables:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>We always get the Z-stat. If Z-stat is not present we pick up the t-stat or p-value (not adjusted for multiple-inference).</li>

  <h3>Subsection notes</h3>
  <p>The following questions ask the mean, standard deviation, and sample size for the outcome of the treatment effect. They loop through the study arms in comparison at baseline and at the period over which the treatment effect was estimated. Please read the prompts carefully before entering your answers.</p>
  
  <p><strong>SurveyCTO instructions:</strong> For the evaluation arm, reference arm and the two arms combined, display the mean, Standard deviation, Standard error and Sample size question for each of them, at baseline and at the period (used to estimate the treatment effect). Please see a presentation of the questions in tables, which would be ideally how the questions presented without the limitations of SurveyCTO. [Please check if we can use this table grid plug-in https://github.com/surveycto/table-grid].</p>

      <li>In IDEAL, the default unit of measurement is the one that entered estimation. Sometimes, authors transformed the baseline outcome variable from the originally collected format into a unit more suitable for estimation, but they reported the baseline statistics for the outcome variable in the original unit. In that case, please select "No", and then specify the unit used at baseline.</li>
      <li>Choose "Yes", if the same unit of measurement was used at baseline and in estimation.</li>
