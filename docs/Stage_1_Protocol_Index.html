      For example, if a coder selects the “Estimand is full sample ITT and LATE/TOT” field in the request-for-review section, they could add an explanation about their uncertainty in this field.<br><br>
      “Unsure regarding the empirical specification of the estimand. The author mentions that 'we view the evaluation design as quasi-experimental and use difference-in-differences to estimate program impact.' Are the estimates indirectly ITT/LATE/TOT or are they only quasi-experimental estimates?”

    <h3>Coding instructions for coders (Hint on SurveyCTO)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Please indicate the number of experiments being evaluated in the paper.</li>
      <li>An experiment is principally defined by the study population and unit of randomization, the intervention, and the randomization used to create comparable treatment arms.</li>
      <li>If results are reported from multiple countries, these are likely coming from different experiments.</li>
      <li>Normally, there is only one experiment being evaluated in a paper, but there are exceptions. Please see the example column. The experimental design section often provides information on how many experiments are being tested in the paper.</li>
      <li>Note that in the pilot, we are not coding studies that are lab-in-the-field experiments. If a study includes a field experiment and a lab-in-the-field experiment, we will only code the field experiment. In that case, please enter 1 for this field.</li>
      <li>We are also not coding studies in which there is a design intervention rather than a policy intervention. A design intervention includes studies that randomize the order or wording of survey questions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Descriptive example</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Barrera-Osorio et al. 2011:</strong> Report effects from two different experiments in Bogota in different parts of the city (San Cristobal and Suba). We know that there are two different experiments because the paper declares "As required by the SED, the assessment of the treatments was divided into two separate experiments located in two very similar localities in Bogota, San Cristobal, and Suba." The paper also reports that eligible populations for the tested interventions are different across the two sites: "Eligible registrants in San Cristobal, ranging from grade 6–11..."; and "The tertiary treatment was evaluated separately in an experiment in Suba, where students ranging from grade nine through eleven..." The response to this field would be <strong>2</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Jeong et al. 2023:</strong> Evaluate the differences in how question modules in a survey are ordered in order to examine the effects of survey fatigue. In this case, the coder should enter <strong>0</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>De Martino et al. 2015:</strong> Conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment on landholders and annual payment offers for environmental services. As the experiment conducted was hypothetical, the coder should enter <strong>0</strong>.
